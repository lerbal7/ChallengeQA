BUG 1
Error: When on responsive mode and clicking on the Edit button, the website scrolls to the top, but the textarea to edit the item is at the bottom of the page.

Expected result: When on responsive, I click on the Edit button and the website scrolls down to the textarea so I can edit the text.
Actual result: When on responsive, the website does not scroll to the textarea. I have to manually scroll to the textarea and edit the text.

1. Go to the main website.

BUG 2
Error: When clicking on Edit button and then deleting that item, if I click on Update Item the item gets created again.

Expected result: When I click on Edit button and then delete the item, the textarea should empty because the item does not exist anymore.
Actual result: When I click on Edit button and then delete the item, the textarea still has the description of the deleted item and by clicking on Update Item, it gets created again.

Actual result: When the element is created, the textarea is emptied but the file remains there until I click on the button to upload a new one.
